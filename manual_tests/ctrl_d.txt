In this test, we want to compare the behavior when pressing Ctrl + D in the following cases

Case 1:
type a command and press Ctrl + d twice
(must be pressed twice for the shell to continue)

example original shell (command sh)
& ls

after of press ctrl+d twice
output
$ lslearning_shell      mini_shell  repos-github  shell_testing  simpleshell  test-c
$ 
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$

we see that the list of files prints a new prompt and exits

case 2
testing with a command that doesn't exist
$ noexist

press ctrl+d twise
output
$ noexistsh: 1: noexist: not found
$ 
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$

followed by the command prints the error, then a new prompt and exits
